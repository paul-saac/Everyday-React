# Components

## What is Components?

**Components** are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

## Defining a component

Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

## Why Use React?

React is widely used because it makes web development:

- **Faster** – Efficient updates using the Virtual DOM  
- **Modular** – Build apps using reusable components  
- **Scalable** – Easy to manage large applications  
- **Maintainable** – Clear structure and separation of concerns

## Core Concepts of React

### 1. Components
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component represents a part of the user interface (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation bars).

Components can be:
- **Functional components**
- **Reusable and independent**

### 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

Example:
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```
