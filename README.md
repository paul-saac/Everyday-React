# React

## What is React?

**React** is an open-source **JavaScript library** used for building **user interfaces (UI)**, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It allows developers to create fast, interactive, and reusable UI components for modern web applications.

React focuses only on the **view layer** of an application, meaning it handles how things look and respond to user interaction.

React was created and is maintained by :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (formerly Facebook).

## Why Use React?

React is widely used because it makes web development:

- **Faster** – Efficient updates using the Virtual DOM  
- **Modular** – Build apps using reusable components  
- **Scalable** – Easy to manage large applications  
- **Maintainable** – Clear structure and separation of concerns

## Core Concepts of React

### 1. Components
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component represents a part of the user interface (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation bars).

Components can be:
- **Functional components**
- **Reusable and independent**

### 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

Example:
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
